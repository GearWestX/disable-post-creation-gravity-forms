# Disable Gravity form random Post creation

Have you ever stumbled upon some random untitled posts with no author, no content and without any security leak on your WordPress website? 

Do you also have Gravity forms installed? 

You might be experiencing a bug with their built-in post creation functions that triggers when a user submits a Gravity Form that has a custom field.

Worry not! I've created a plugin using their same built-in posts function, formerly named gform_disable_post_creation that will automatically disable that headache of yours.
